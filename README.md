A mobile application using the framework flutter and the programming language Dart,
allows patients to add all their reports and prescriptions and request a consultation from doctors based on the region and specialization, 
so that the doctor can then review the patientsâ€™ requests and approve them and transfer them to the nearest pharmacy to the patient,
and the pharmacy in turn By setting medication appointments for the patient, 
so that the patient can be alerted to them on time.
